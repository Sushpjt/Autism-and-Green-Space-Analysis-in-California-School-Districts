# Autism and Green Space Analysis in California School Districts

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between green space and autism prevalence in California public elementary school districts. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis and regression-based machine learning models, we examine whether tree canopy, forest coverage, and other environmental features are associated with autism rates â€” especially in high road density (urbanized) areas.

The analysis is inspired by [a published NIH study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6104398/) and uses publicly available data from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/autism-and-green-space-clean).
